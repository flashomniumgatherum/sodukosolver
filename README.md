# sodukosolver

This Python module can solve Sodoku problems. 

**HOW TO SOVLE**

To run the solver:
python pySudoku.py Sudokus.txt

To run the generator:
python Generator.py

Of course, you can use the solver with any text file that contains Sudoku puzzles.
The generator writes to a file named "SudokuPuzzles.txt", with each puzzle being represented as one line of integers read from the top left to the bottom right of the grid.
